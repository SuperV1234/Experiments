Game in an afternoon

* C++14, Emscripten, OpenGL -> web game
* Bullet-hell gameplay
* "Starfield", "Crowd", whatever
* Gameplay:
    * Game is divided in waves
    * Waves are finished by collecting N special items
        * After collecting the items, a timer may appear
    * Waves consist in dodging random starfield-like bullet curtains
    * Patterns are detailed by two increasing variables
        * Density
        * Speed
    * Waves can have special mutators
        * Curving bullets
        * Bigger bullets (huge)
        * Smaller bullets (popcorn)
        * Lasers that will appear in a huge area after a warning
        * Square bullets
    * Scoring is increased by grazing bullets and by getting risky score powerups
    * Move with arrow keys
    * Can focus with shift
    * Choose difficulty: normal/hardcore
* Technical details:
    * Use vrm::gl, vrm::sdl
    * Use a single sprite_batch for all entities
    * Only AABB-point and circle-point collision detection is required
        * Maybe some dumb grid spatial partition?
    * Component-based design?
        * sparse_int_set, positions[], velocities[], accelerations[], curve[]
